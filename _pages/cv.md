Education
======
* Ph.D in Genetics, Kunming Institute of Zoology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2020 (supervisor Prof. [Wen WANG](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OZ-l-uYAAAAJ))
* B.S. in Biology, Wuhan University, 2014
  * Minor in Computer Science, Wuhan University, 2014

Work experience
======
* June 2024 - present: Postdoctoral Fellowship
  * the University of Hong Kong
  * Duties included: Analysis of sequencing (single-cell/CRISPR screen/Perturb-seq/bulk RNA-seq/ATAC-seq) and imaging data.
  * Supervisor: Assoc. Prof. [Carmen C.L. WONG](https://www.carmenwong-lab.com/)
  * Achievements:
    * Analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing data of the tumor mouse model to facilitate the development of combined immune-checkpoint blockade therapy for hepatocyte carcinoma.
    * Analyzed perturb-seq dataset to investigate the epigenetic regulation in cancer cell lines, identified the underlying gene modules, and explored the biological function.

* September 2021 - May 2024: Postdoctoral Fellowship
  * Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI)
  * Duties included: Research (human genetics, population genomics) and scientific support
  * Supervisor: Prof. [Xin JIN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eyfJjQwAAAAJ)
  * Achievements:
    * Participated in the drafts of research proposal materials to promote National Genome Projects (for the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Serbia, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia). Participated in a successful application for an international scientific cooperation grant.
    * Participated in developing a method for screening markers for complex disease using multi-omics data, patent submitted.
    * Participated in resolving the T2T genome reference for the Chinese population, paper published in Cell Research (co-first author).
    * Led and finished the analysis of natural selection of 2q12.3, which affected the immune function of East-Asians, papers under submission (Journal of Genetics and Genomics).

* September 2020 - August 2021: Researcher
  * Zhengbang Group
  * Duties included: Establishing genomics breeding platform
